# Business-Analysis-Project

ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project performs business analytics on user traffic and engagement data.
It demonstrates the complete process from data cleaning â†’ preprocessing â†’ exploratory data analysis (EDA) â†’ visualizations, providing insights into user behavior, engagement, and traffic sources.
Technologies Used

Python 

Pandas (data cleaning & manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)

NumPy (aggregations & numeric operations)

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps
Data Cleaning
Renamed columns
Converted DateHour into datetime format
Converted numerical columns into correct types
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics (.info(), .describe())
Missing value handling
Visualizations
Sessions & Users Over Time
Users by Channel Group
Engaged vs Non-Engaged Sessions
Traffic Heatmap (by Hour & Channel)
Engagement Rate vs Sessions Over Time
Insights

Some channels drive high traffic but lower engagement.

Non-engaged sessions highlight areas for improvement in user retention.

Peak traffic hours differ across channel groups.

Engagement rate trends provide actionable insights for campaign performance.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Add interactive dashboards (Plotly / Power BI).

Extend analysis with predictive modeling.

Automate reporting pipelines.
